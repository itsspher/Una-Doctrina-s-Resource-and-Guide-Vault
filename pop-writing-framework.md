# how you were taught to write

> Academic writing is bad writing. It doesn't make sense, it's deliberately obscure, it's really confusing.

apply the above to business writing

we were trained to use the following

- statistics
- data points
- buzzwords
- sound academic

none of this shit matters

# how you should write

> The key to making writing worthwhile is making it memorable.

when people remember your writing, they act on your ideas

> Get your ideas stuck in their heads. Just like a catchy pop song.

when ideas are stuck in peoples heads, the time that idea spends stuck in their heads allows people to see the full depth of your writing.

writing is, at its core, **communication**.

# the three elements of POP

**Personal**, **Observational**, and **Playful**

# personal

recalling a personal experience allows you to instantly **have a human connection to the reader**.

use senses, or use experiences, such as:

- "I saw..."
- "I heard..."
- "You've been at a..."
- "You've noticed..."

the personal component can be at odds with the observational, but when used well, they work together really well.

how do you **speak to the shared experiences** of you and the reader?

## the tools

stories

- tell a story about your life
- write about private or intense emotions

shared experiences

- write about what it's like to do X

open the memory bank

- refer to things that have happened in the past

# observational

reveal new insights to **make your audience say**:

> I never saw that before, but now I can't stop seeing it.

what are **things that you've noticed that others haven't**?

- "I noticed a pattern..."
- "You don't know this but..."
- "The best-kept secret is..."

train yourself to observe more in the real world.  
unlike screens, the resolution of the real world is near-infinite. there's a lot that you don't see, and if you take the time to see it, you can derive unique insights.

look at everything as if it's the **first** and **last** time you see it.

if it's your first time:  
nothing is taken for granted

if it's your last time:  
each moment is scarce, so pay attention

## the tools

bed, bath, bus

- transient spaces where our brains are [left to wander](diffuse-thinking) are great places to make observations

capture your ideas

- write down your epiphanies or any idea that really gets to you

look for surprises

- if something surprises either you or another person you're with, note it down

make things unfamiliar

- when things become familiar, we stop looking at the world

# playful

> If it's not fun, why bother?  
> - Reggie Fils-AimÃ©, former CEO of Nintendo America

you should be able to make other people just as excited about your ideas as you are

all writing is just the same as storytelling, putting on a play, playing a game, etc. etc.

**ideas are fun**

> "I'm passionate about this, so you should be too."

this wins you favor with people, which gets you readers, which allows you to get the message across easier

## the tools

play like a theatre

- personify things
- make up characters
- have some conflict or a sort of plot

mind games

- use thought experiments ("imagine that you...")

lightheartedness

- use fun analogies
- refer to pop culture (but not too much)
- use pictures and illustrations

play with language

- use interesting rhetorical devices
- repetition
- alliteration

# what now?

**don't do anything right now**

when you start reading, look for the POP framework

when you find it, make mental notes, or save them somewhere

look at how others do it, and steal their tactics

the more you do it, the more you internalize it, the more you improve
