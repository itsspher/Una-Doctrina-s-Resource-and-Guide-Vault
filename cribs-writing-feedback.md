# CRIBS: a writing feedback formula

anyone can become a good editor for you if you ask them to critique your work using this framework. it allows them to focus on their emotions as they read the work, which is what most people will experience when they read as well.

**Confusing**  

if your writing is confusing, that means you're not communicating well.

*what to do:* simplify your thoughts. simplify your words. 

**Repeated**

repetition wastes attention, wastes time, and is an insult to the writer's intelligence.

*what to do:* delete the repetitive parts.

**Interesting**

interest is what drives a reader to a work, what drives a reader through a work, and what drives a reader to past a work.

*what to do:* take the interesting ideas you present and double down on them. 

**Boring**

readers don't like to be bored. it is a cardinal sin as a write to bore your audience.

*what to do:* if something is boring, delete or rewrite it. if the idea is the problem, cut it. if the delivery is the problem, rewrite it.

**Surprising**

you as a writer need to be able to tell the reader things they didn't know. surprise can often "blow the mind" of a reader, and in that mind destruction you can offer the reconstruction.

*what to do:* delete everything that is not surprising. build tension to the surprise.
