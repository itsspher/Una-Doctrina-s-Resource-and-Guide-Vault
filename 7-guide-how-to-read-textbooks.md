# How to Read Textbooks

We now approach the very bane of every student's existence, the one
thing that makes us or breaks us: textbooks. The very word can send
shivers down one student's spine, or cause another to involuntarily
yawn. If you're one of these students, this guide is for you!

In today's guide I aim to help you attack textbooks and make the most
out of your reading materials. This post is going to be heavy, so stay
with me. I guarantee you will benefit from this.

The very first method I'm about to explain is a method called SQ3R,
which I have extracted from a psychology textbook. SQ3R stands for
Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review, each of these being steps
guiding your way through a text book. I consider this method to be a
skeleton to which you can frame your textbook reading venture. The steps
go as follows:

**Step 1 - Survey**: Get a general overview of the material by glancing (and
I mean it, glancing only) at titles and headings. It's all to get a
general idea of the material, that's it. Really. Applicable to bolded
words within the segments.

**Step 2 - Question**: Convert the heading of each section into a question.
You can even form more than one question for a heading. For example, if
the heading is "The Stimulus: Light", the questions can be "how is light
a stimulus?", "what does light stimulate?", "what are the effects of
light stimulus?", etc. Let your curiosity take hold of this one.

**Step 3 - Read**: Now that you have your questions formed, read the segment
with the aim of answering those questions. Not only does this focus your
attention on understanding the material, it also saves you the confusion
of just simply jumping into the text without any priming. I will
illustrate methods of active reading that can enhance the benefits
during this step later on.

**Step 4 - Recite**: Recite the answers to the questions out loud to
yourself, and in your own words. Don't be afraid to discuss it with
yourself, it helps you understand the concepts and relate to it better,
as well as understand the relationships between different concepts. You
may also want to write these ideas down so you can review them later. DO
NOT MOVE ON TO THE SEGMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE SEGMENT YOU ARE
ON.

\-- Repeat steps 2 to 4 as you move through each segment \--

**Step 5 - Review**: After reading the entire chapter, go back to refresh
your memory of the concepts you have established. Try to answer the
questions without referring to your notes/book. This part is to fortify
your retention.

If the textbooks don't have a lot of headings, you can reverse steps 2
and 3 and form questions as you read. This framework is very flexible,
thus feel free to experiment with it when you can.

Besides the SQ3R, I'm about to show you another framework I got from
this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqYmmZKY4sA). It's similar
to the SQ3R but very different, and might be appealing to some. I
personally apply this to my lecture powerpoint slides because I find it
more helpful.

1.  Flip through each page JUST TO SEE WHAT IT IS. It's not quite the Survey step from earlier, but rather a very broad aspect you can gather from the textbook. Take note of the workload, pictures, and overall structure. Don't read it. Seriously.

2.  Check out the end of chapter quizzes or learning objectives (if applicable). This is to know what to look for. This is practically the fast food version of the Question step earlier.

3.  Go back to the beginning of the chapter and just read the bold words. Headings, titles, bold words, and all that applies. This is just the Survey step that I just mentioned. Easy. This is for you to get a sense of the main ideas of the chapter.

4.  Go back and read the FIRST and LAST sentences of EACH paragraph. Yes. You go back again to the beginning, and do that. At this point you're only reading for exposure. It's like dipping your  toes first into the lake. Better than being thrown into the water and freezing to death, no? You don't have to understand anything at all. Seriously. This is just for exposure.

5.  NOW you read the chapter. I am going to show you active reading methods that you can use when following this step. Again, like previously mentioned, read the text with the questions/objectives you have seen be in mind.

See, you look at this framework and might think "this is so tedious".
And honestly, I'll say the same thing this lecturer has said in the
video I linked, this is much better than reading this text from the
beginning and having to reread 10 times until you just mildly understand
the text and go on not even remembering anything. "Repetition is the
mother of learning" stands true here.

Next, I'll list a few methods to actively read your textbooks and get
the most out of them. You can incorporate these into the frameworks that
I have shown you, or work around with these and see how they benefit
you.

1.  Review/Summary Method
    > Simply summarise what you understood from the text. You can
    > summarise every paragraph, or by every section you personally
    > divide. It is up to your preference. Feel free to write these
    > summaries down on the textbook itself or on a piece of paper. It
    > does NOT have to be neat or organised, just clear enough to be
    > understood. You can keep these notes and write them down in a
    > notebook however you want to organise it. For now, this is just to
    > engage your brain with the material. You're also engaging your
    > muscle memory along with your eyes. This is why I recommend
    > writing this by hand rather than typing it.\
    > My recommendation: try the flow note-taking style with it.
    > Definitely helped me understand liver anatomy.

2.  Memory-boost method
    > Grab a bunch of old papers or some ditzy notebook and a pencil.
    > Before your eyes is a list of important keywords you think you
    > should definitely remember for your course. Write that list down
    > on the old paper, then rewrite it again without looking. It
    > doesn't matter if you don't remember it, but try to associate that
    > list with general ideas. Look at the original list, then cover it
    > up and write it down again. Repeat the process until you get the
    > list down. This one is pretty nitty-gritty, but allow me to defend
    > it. This way, you're finding associations between the material
    > you're memorizing, and the things you know in real life. You're
    > putting your attempt to memorize this list on paper, and engaging
    > more than one sense in this learning process can help boost your
    > memory. Once you're confident you've got the material memorised,
    > feel free to toss that mess away. You don't have to keep it.

3.  Think like a teacher method
    > Grab 2 colours (highlighters/coloured pencils) and use them to
    > highlight things that you think you as a teacher will include in
    > the test. It's pretty simple. Use one colour to highlight the main
    > idea, and the other to highlight ideas relevant to the main idea.

4.  Marginal notes
    > Summarise the take away point of each paragraph and write it down
    > on the empty margin next to the paragraph OR on a sticky-note.
    > Super condense this one, this is to help you navigate your
    > textbook better for when you need to go back and review your book.
    > A method of summarising this is by using the RTS method:\
    > R- read the paragraph\
    > T- think about what the author was trying to deliver in this
    > paragraph\
    > S- summarise.\
    > Easy.

5.  Mind Maps
    > You can create a mind map to condense the information present in
    > an entire chapter. This is to help you establish the relationships
    > between each segment present in a chapter, hence forming
    > connections and drawing your learning together.

6.  Study Guide
    > Create something like a cheat sheet of everything you need to know
    > for the exam. E.g. for math you will have a paper or two filled
    > with equations you need to know. Include theories that you have
    > difficulty understanding/remembering ONLY. Do not repeat any
    > information and avoid redundancy at all costs. Keep it short and
    > clean. If you want, add some sticky notes with examples that can
    > help you understand these theories better. Just don't take these
    > inside the exam room with you. Cheating is a shit move.

7.  Einstein Strategy
    > Einstein once said something along the lines of "if you can't
    > teach the material to a 6 year old, you didn't really learn
    > anything". I probably quoted this wrong but you probably
    > understand what I mean. Read the material as if you are going to
    > teach it to a 6 year old kid. If you do not have a 6 year-old
    > available, summon your 6 year-old self using a summoning circle
    > and teach em. No excuses.

8.  Personal connection
    > Try to establish personal connections with what you're reading. If
    > the material is reminding you of something
    > funny/relatable/erotic/plain fucking weird then don't hesitate to
    > make that association. I'm serious. As long as no one knows you're
    > good to go. Go wild with this one.

9.  Post-it notes
    > Use 1 to 2 notes to summarise the ENTIRE chapter. I mean it. Just
    > maximum 2. You can apply this with literature even. It helps you
    > understand what each chapter contains in case you need to go back.

With all this, I hope these methods have provided you with any form of
help or inspiration. If you have different methods, feel free to share
them in Una Doctrina, and let me know if these methods are helpful in
any way. After all this typing I actually need a peptalk.
