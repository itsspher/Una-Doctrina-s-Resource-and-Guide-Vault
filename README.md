# Una Doctrina's Resource and Guide Vault

This repository is a collection of resources and guides dedicated to **studying, going through coursework, and learning how to learn better**.

Anyone is welcome to contribute, you can send a pull request, or discuss additions in the Una Doctrina subclub.

This repository also functions as an [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md), and can be downloaded for offline use with the application.

## A cautionary note

We present these guides as tools for your to use. **Unless you actively apply them, they do nothing for you.** You need to find what works for you personally, and **what actually produces results**. It's very easy to dive into these and think *"Oh, I'm being super productive"*, and then neglect the actual work you need to do.

None of the given resources are guaranteed to work for you. Experiment and find out what works and what doesn't. Once you find that, hunker down and do the work.
