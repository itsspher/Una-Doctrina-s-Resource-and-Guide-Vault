# Writing to build understanding

Before you go on to using [Active Recall and Spaced Repetition](Active%20Recall%20and%20Spaced%20Repetition.md), you need to first **understand** the topics at hand. After all, revision assumes you already know what you need to know, and are just reinforcing your understanding.

Here, we will outline a method to build understanding through writing lecture notes.

## The method

It's very simple: write a document about the topic you need to study, **from memory**, and as simple as you can make it, without losing any details.[^1]

[^1]: You're going to want to assemble some reference material beforehand to make this process smoother, as well as having your e-mail open to contact your professors for questions.

In writing the document, you are expected to write first drafts, then second drafts, then more and more, until you're confident that you fully understand the topic, and that there are no more gaps in your understanding.

Any gaps in understanding should be phrased as a question in the document, to be answered in a revision.

This is an extension of the popular [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/), except leveraging the power of writing to expand brain power.

## An example

So for example, say you needed to learn Propositional logic. A first draft of the document would look something like this: 

### First draft

> Propositional logic
> 
> In propositional logic, we have declarative statements, all of which are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 
> 
> These statements need to be well defined (why?? what does well defined mean??).
> 
> ...

---

We can see here that while we have the basic understanding, we still have gaps in our knowledge. After doing some reading and research, we go on to the second draft:

### Second draft

> Propositional logic
> 
> In propositional logic, we have declarative statements, all of which are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 
> 
> These statements need to be well defined, meaning that the truth value can be derived from the statement itself, with no further explanation. For example, the phrase ""*Plants breathe air*"" is well defined, while the phrase "*X is greater than 5*" isn't, as that phrase needs further explanation.
> 
> ...

---

We now have a more complete version of the explanation, and thus a more complete understanding on the topic. A student would then continue to read and research, then build more of this document from memory, until they have explained what they need to understand.

## Caveats

While this method can apply to all forms of study, this method works best for subjects such as the humanities, where understanding is measured through essays and written explanations. Subjects such as Math or Physics are better off doing practice problems, as those are the best way to develop intuitive understanding of the topics in those subjects.
